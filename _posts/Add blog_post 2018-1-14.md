##JBoss:

 The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (or JBoss EAP) is a open-source Java EE-based application server runtime platform used for building,
 deploying, and hosting highly-transactional Java applications and services. The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is part of the JBoss Enterprise
 Middleware portfolio of software. Because it is java-based, the JBoss application server operates across platforms. It is usable on any operating system that supports java.
 The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform was developed by JBoss. The JBoss community creates open source projects for 15-20 years.
 
 ##Google Code-In:
 
  Google Code-In is a open source competition for pre-university students age range 13-17 years.
  I have got to know about this contest from one of my friend via social media. I think Google Code-In has helped me 
  a lot to contribute in the community. Also, I have got a chance to know about Google contests facilities. 
  It is first but a great experience. I think GCI(Google Code-In) can be a great source of  inspiration to teenagers.
  It can encourage the young generation to grow their interest about Information Technology and help them to learn more.

<h2>My Participation in GCI 2017 and JBoss Community.</h2>

My name is Momtahina Karim Meem. I am a student participating in GCI(Google Code-In) 2017. I am 13 years old from Chittagong, Bangladesh. I read in Aunkur Society Girl’s High School in 7th grade. I am a programmer, blogger and a web developer.

I have completed 6 tasks(1.Write a blog post/article on OpenMRS & publish in a blog/web/forum 2.Blog A: Write a Blog Article about Your Participation in the Contest and Add a Picture and Introduction of Yourself 3.Become a part of the community 4.OSGeo: add yourself to the OSGeo member map 5.[D4D – Machine Learning] Create a Document 6.Write a blog post on any GCI task you’ve completed) till now. I really had a great experience on these tasks.

I have given many contests but, this is my first Google competition. Google Code-In is a open source competition for pre-university students age range 13-17 years. I have got to know about this contest from one of my friend via social media. I think Google Code-In has helped me a lot to contribute in the community. Also, I have got a chance to know about Google contests facilities. It is first but a great experience. I think GCI(Google Code-In) can be a great source of  inspiration to teenagers. It can encourage the young generation to grow their interest about Information Technology and help them to learn more. Now, I am doing the 7th task  from JBoss Community(Write a blog on GCI event website about your GCI experience) which is about writing a blog.  The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (or JBoss EAP) is a open-source Java EE-based application server runtime platform used for building, deploying, and hosting highly-transactional Java applications and services. The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is part of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware portfolio of software.

The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform was developed by JBoss. The JBoss community creates open source projects for 15-20 years. It is really cool!!

Through, it is my first Google Code-In contest it has inspired me a lot. From now, I want to participate In Google Code-In every year.
