##JBoss:

 The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (or JBoss EAP) is a open-source Java EE-based application server runtime platform used for building,
 deploying, and hosting highly-transactional Java applications and services. The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is part of the JBoss Enterprise
 Middleware portfolio of software. Because it is java-based, the JBoss application server operates across platforms. It is usable on any operating system that supports java.
 The JBoss Enterprise Application Platform was developed by JBoss. The JBoss community creates open source projects for 15-20 years.
 
 ##Google Code-In:
 
  Google Code-In is a open source competition for pre-university students age range 13-17 years.
  I have got to know about this contest from one of my friend via social media. I think Google Code-In has helped me 
  a lot to contribute in the community. Also, I have got a chance to know about Google contests facilities. 
  It is first but a great experience. I think GCI(Google Code-In) can be a great source of  inspiration to teenagers.
  It can encourage the young generation to grow their interest about Information Technology and help them to learn more.
